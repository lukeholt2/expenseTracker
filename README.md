# Plutus

`Plutus` is the updated UI intended for interacting with the [`ExpenseAPI`](https://gitlab.internal.oasis.com/gitlab-instance-8c9d9f19/expenseapp), allowing for custom expense tracking and budgeting. 

## Development

The project is built using `Nextjs` and thus can simply be installed using `npm`:

```script
npm i
```

Then to run the development server simply run:

```script
npm run dev
```
